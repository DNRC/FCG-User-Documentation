# Managing Users

The actions on this page can only be completed if a user has the
Manager application role or higher. These users can approve role
requests, view user information, and disable users in the system.

## Approving Role Requests

To approve user role requests, navigate to the Users page using the `Users`
link on the header page. Next, click the `Manage Requests` link. Here you will
see a list of the pending requests with the name of the requested user, the requested
role, and the reason for the request. Next to the request, there are two buttons
labeled 'Approve' and 'Reject' that either approve or decline the request for the
specific role request.

## Viewing System Users

To view all users known to the system, navigate to the Users page
using the `Users` link on the header page. Here you will see the
display name, actual name, and role of each user that is registered
with the application.

## Changing User Permissions

It is possible to change a user's role without having them submit a
role request. On the code list page, find the user whose role you want
to change, and click on their name. A dialog will appear that show's
the user's current role, including the permissions that they have.
Selecting a different role from the dropdown will show the
permissions that the user would have if they had that role. To apply
the selected role, click on the save button at the bottom of the
dialog. This button will only appear when a different role is selected
than the user currently has.

## Disabling Users in the System

Due to the change tracking functionality built into the application, it
is impossible to remove users outright. Instead, they must be given
the Public role, which gives them the same permissions as someone who
is not logged into the app.
